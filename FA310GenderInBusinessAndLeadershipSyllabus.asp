<h4>Course Description</h4>
<p>In this online class, we will examine issues regarding the role of gender in society and leadership.  We will explore the major gender issues facing society today, such as equal employment opportunity, leadership styles, and the balancing of work and family.  Students will be exposed to a variety of conceptual frameworks and perspectives. They may use these frameworks for interpreting problems and solutions. We will explore each framework or perspective by applying it to case studies.  We will reflect on the effectiveness and shortcomings of each perspective and evaluate the effectiveness of leadership styles without regard to gender. </p>

<h4>Course Expectations</h4>
<h4>Grading Policies and Practices</h4>
<p>To complete the course, you must complete each of the assignments as described in the course and submit them to your instructor by the assigned deadline.&nbsp; In addition, you must participate in the course discussion forum by responding to all instructor requests and by interacting with fellow classmates as necessary.</p>
<p>Points are deducted for late work.</p>
<p>Grades will be available 7 days from the due date of a particular assignment.</p>
<h4>General Assessment Criteria for All Writing Assignments</h4>
<p>All writing assignments are expected to conform to basic college-level standards of mechanics and presentation.</p>
<p> Consider visiting the Writing Center to discuss your assignments for this course or any others. You may schedule appointments (30 or 50 minutes) on an as&ndash;needed or weekly basis, scheduling up to 3 hours worth of appointments per week. Online services include Feedback&ndash;by&ndash;Email and IM conferencing (with or without a webcam). All writing center services are free.</p>
<p>Writing Center tutors are specially selected and trained graduate and undergraduate students who can help you at almost any stage of your writing. They will not do your work for you, but they can help you focus and develop your ideas, review your drafts, and polish your writing. They can answer questions about grammar, mechanics, different kinds of writing styles, and documentation formats. They also can answer questions and provide feedback online, through IM/webcam chats and email. </p>
<p>Obviously, the tutors won&rsquo;t necessarily be familiar with every class or subject, but they are able to provide valuable help from the perspective of an interested and careful reader as well as a serious and experienced student-writer.</p>
<p>Schedule your appointments with enough time to think about and use the feedback you&rsquo;ll receive. To schedule a Face-to-Face, Written Feedback by Email, or Online Appointment, visit <a href="http://www.depaul.edu/writing">www.depaul.edu/writing</a><a href="http://www.depaul.edu/writing" target="_blank"></a>.</p>
<h4>Discussion Forums </h4>
<p>Discussion Forums are  an important component of your online experience. This course contains  discussion forums related to the topics you are studying each week. For  requirements on your participation in the Discussion Forums, please see &ldquo;Course  Expectations&rdquo; in the syllabus. </p>
<p>A Course Q &amp; A  discussion forum has also been established to manage necessary, ongoing social  and administrative activities. This is where the management and administrative  tasks of the course are conducted, and where you can ask &lsquo;process&rsquo; questions  and receive answers throughout the course. Please feel free to answer any  question if you feel you know the answer; this sharing of information is  valuable to other students. </p>
<h4>Online Participation Guidelines </h4>
<p>A significant part of your online learning experience involves learning with and from your classmates and the instructor in the online discussions and group assignments. Active participation means sharing information and resources and posting you ideas and critiquing and expanding on the ideas of others in a collegial fashion. This discussion is informal in the sense that it is meant to encourage interested discussion. </p>
<p>You are expected to follow accepted standards of English spelling, grammar and usage, although you will not be assessed for these particular characteristics when you are participating in the discussions.</p>
<p>These discussions are for you to exchange your reflections with your classmates and instructor about what you are learning. The discussions will be organized into forums around the particular topic(s) you are studying each week.</p>
<p>You may be asked by the instructor to take leadership in a certain group for a certain time of the course. You will receive further instructions from your instructor if this occurs. You should contribute your responses to the particular assignment for that particular discussion heading which will be posted. For each Discussion Forum, you are required to make at least one original contribution to each topic and respond to one or more classmates&rsquo; contributions.</p>
<h4>Course Etiquette</h4>
<p>Online discussions are an important part of your course experience. To ensure a positive learning environment, please follow the following minimum expectations. Use your common sense, as not all situations can be covered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be polite</li>
  <li>Respect other participants&rsquo; views or opinions</li>
  <li>Think before you write, and ask yourself if you would say the same thing in person</li>
  <li>Use positive phrases (i.e., &quot;Good idea!&quot; or &quot;Thanks for the suggestions,&quot; etc.)</li>
  <li>Be sensitive to cultural differences</li>
  <li>Avoid hostile, curt or sarcastic comments</li>
  <li>No objectionable, sexist, or racist language will be tolerated</li>
  <li>Create a positive online community by offering assistance and support to other participants.</li>
  <li>Use correct grammar and syntax</li>
</ul>
<h4>Time Management and Attendance</h4>
<p>SNL courses are not self-paced and require a regular time commitment EACH week throughout the quarter. You are required to log in to your course regularly so that you can participate in the ongoing course discussions. Online courses are no less time consuming than &quot;face to face&quot; courses. You will have to dedicate some time every day or at least every second day to your studies. A typical four credit hour &quot;face to face&quot; course at SNL involves three hours of classroom meeting per week, plus at least three to six hours of study and homework per week.</p>
<p>This course will require at least the same time commitment, but your learning activities will be spread out through the week. If you have any problems with your technology, or if you need to improve your reading or writing skills, it may take even longer.</p>
<p>The instructor should be notified if your life events do not allow you to participate in the course and the online discussions for more than one week. This is particularly important when there are group discussions or you are working as part of a team.<br />
</p>
<p>If you find yourself getting behind, please contact the instructor immediately.</p>
<h4>Your Instructor's Role</h4>
<p>Your instructor's role in this course is that of a discussion facilitator and learning advisor. It is not their responsibility to make sure you log in regularly and submit your assignments. As instructor, s/he will read all postings to the general discussion forums on a daily basis but may not choose to respond to each posting. You will receive feedback to assignments. The instructor may choose to designate &quot;office hours&quot; when s/he will be online and available and will immediately respond to questions. Depending on the instructor, this response may be by e-mail, instant messenger or telephone. Otherwise, you will generally receive a response to emailed or posted queries within 48 hours.</p>
<h4>Your Role as a Student</h4>
<p>As an online student, you will be taking a proactive approach to your learning. As the course instructor's role is that of a learning guide, your role is that of the leader in your own learning.<br />
  </p>
<p>You will be managing your own time so that you can complete the readings, activities and assignments for the course, and you will also be expected to take a more active role in peer learning.<br />
  <br />
  Please also note that this is a course offered by DePaul University's School for New Learning (SNL), a college for undergraduate and graduate degree-seeking students 24 years and older. SNL welcomes the perspectives and encourages the participation of all DePaul students, and students who take this course should respect and be mindful of SNL's mission in supporting a diverse and inclusive environment. More information about SNL can be found&nbsp;<a href="snl.depaul.edu">here</a><a href="https://snl.depaul.edu">.</a><br />
</p>
<h4>Course Policies </h4>
<p>This course will adhere to the principles of academic integrity outlined in DePaul University&rsquo;s Student Handbook. </p>
<p>The DePaul Student Handbook clearly defines plagiarism.  Plagiarism will not be accepted and will result in a failure of the assignment or possibly the course.  If you need assistance in knowing how to cite a resource, please ask for assistance.</p>
<p>To complete the course, you must complete each of the assignments as described in the course and submit them to your instructor by the assigned deadline. In addition, you must participate in the course discussion forum by responding to all instructor requests and by interacting with fellow classmates as necessary.<br />
  <br />
  Points are deducted for late work.</p>
<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
<p>DePaul University is a learning community that fosters the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas within a context that emphasizes a sense of responsibility for oneself, for others and for society at large. Violations of academic integrity, in any of their forms, are, therefore, detrimental to the values of DePaul, to the students' own development as responsible members of society, and to the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas.<br />

<p>Violations include but are not limited to the following categories: cheating; plagiarism; fabrication; falsification or sabotage of research data; destruction or misuse of the university's academic resources; alteration or falsification of academic records; and academic misconduct. Conduct that is punishable under the Academic Integrity Policy could result in additional disciplinary actions by other university officials and possible civil or criminal prosecution. Please refer to your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.depaul.edu/university-catalog/academic-handbooks/Pages/default.aspx">Student Handbook</a>&nbsp;for further details.</p>

<h4>DePaul University Incomplete Policy</h4>
<p>The intent of the Incomplete grade is to allow students extra time to complete their final assignments. This need arises because, in the closing weeks of the course, they have an event of significant magnitude that adversely affects their ability to complete the course, e.g. serious illness, death in the family, overseas deployment, or natural disaster.<br />
</p>
<p>You must request an incomplete grade in writing two weeks before the end of the quarter. Incomplete grades will be considered only after you have satisfactorily completed at least 75 percent of the coursework, and you have such an unexpected, uncontrollable event that prevents you from completing your course. Do not assume that you will qualify for an incomplete. Students who are failing the course at the point where they request an incomplete will not receive one, nor will they be granted after the end of the quarter. Incomplete grades are given at the discretion of the instructor.<br />
</p>
<p>If you do receive permission from the instructor to take an incomplete in the course, you will be required to complete a contract with the instructor, specifying how you will finish the missing work within the next two quarters (excluding summer). See the&nbsp;<a href="Incomplete Grade Contract Form">Incomplete Grade Contract Form</a><a href="http://snl.depaul.edu/student-resources/undergraduate-resources/Pages/forms.aspx">.</a><br />
</p>
<p>Undergraduate and graduate students will have up to two quarters to complete an incomplete. At the end of the second quarter (excluding summer) following the term in which the incomplete grade was assigned, remaining incompletes will automatically convert to &quot;F&quot; grades. Ordinarily no incomplete grade may be completed after the grace period has expired. Instructors may not change incomplete grades after the end of the grace period without the permission of a college-based Exceptions Committee. This policy applies to undergraduate, graduate and professional programs. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In the case of a student who has applied for graduation and who has been approved for an Incomplete in his or her final term, the incomplete must be resolved within the four-week grace period before final degree certification. </p>
<h4>Students With Disabilities</h4>
<p>Students seeking disability-related accommodations are required to register with DePaul's&nbsp;Center for Students with Disabilities&nbsp;(CSD) enabling you to access accommodations and support services to assist your success. </p>

<p>Students can also email the Center for Students with Disabilities at <a href="mailto:csd@depaul.edu">csd@depaul.edu</a>. <br />
</p>
<p>Students are also invited to contact their instructor privately to discuss your challenges and how the instructor may assist in facilitating the accommodations you will use in this course. This is best done early in the term and the conversation will remain confidential.</p>
